# ParsEval (PCFG Parser Evaluation)

## 1. Objective
We compare the performance of two famous parsers; the **Berkeley parser** and the **Stanford parser**. In order to measure their performances, we test them on 3 test files containing test sentences and evaluate their performance with respect to the corresponding gold standard parse trees in test gold files.

## 2. Parsers
We have compared these two famous parsers. They are available in the websites mentioned below.

* [**Berkeley Parser**](https://github.com/slavpetrov/berkeleyparser)
* [**Stanford Parser**](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml)

## 3. Test files
We have 3 sets of test files. Each set contained a `{1, 2, 3}.plain` file which have the test sentences. They also contain a `{1, 2, 3}.gold` file which has the corresponding parse trees for the test sentences in the `.plain` files. Along with these, we have also appended these files together to create the `Overall` test file and the corresponding Overall gold standard parse file.

## 4. Files in this project
Here is the list of filesin this project and their purposes for ready reference. The files are:
* **README**: This file contains the complete comprehensive details of the entire assignment.
* **new.prm**: This is the parameter file that was used for the EVALB evaluation. A few parameters were changed which have been discussed in the Evaluation section (6) below.
* **lexparser_modified.sh**: This is the modified shell script file which was used for the Stanford parser. Details about the changes are mentioned in the Preprocessing for Stanford Parser section (7) below.
* **“Berkley” folder**: This folder contains the following files:
  1. Parsed files of Berkeley parser
  2. Labeled results of EVALB evaluation
  3. Unlabeled results of EVALB evaluation
* **“Stanford” folder**: Similar to the Berkeley folder, just for the Stanford parser.
* **“Significance_tests” folder**: This folder contains the results of Approximate Randomization method for unlabeled and labeled data for the threshold probabilities of `0.5`, `0.05` and `0.01`.
* **remove_ROOT.py**: Python script for postprocessing the parse trees generated by the Stanford parser to remove the `ROOT` node from the trees.
* **sig_test.py**: Python script containing the entire implementation of the Approxiimate Randomization evaluation method.
