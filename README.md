# ParsEval (PCFG Parser Evaluation)

## 1. Objective
We compare the performance of two famous parsers; the **Berkeley parser** and the **Stanford parser**. In order to measure their performances, we test them on 3 test files containing test sentences and evaluate their performance with respect to the corresponding gold standard parse trees in test gold files.

## 2. Parsers
We have compared these two famous parsers. They are available in the websites mentioned below.

* [**Berkeley Parser**](https://github.com/slavpetrov/berkeleyparser)
* [**Stanford Parser**](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml)

## 3. Test files
We have 3 sets of test files. Each set contained a `{1, 2, 3}.plain` file which have the test sentences. They also contain a `{1, 2, 3}.gold` file which has the corresponding parse trees for the test sentences in the `.plain` files.
